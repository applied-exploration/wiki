Generalization of the inverse matrix

A common use of the pseudoinverse is to compute a "best fit"  solution to a system of linear equations that lacks a solution. Another use is to find the minimum (Euclidean) norm solution to a system of linear equations with multiple solutions.

It can be computed using the singular value [[decomposition]]
