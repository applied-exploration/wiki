This is how much one vector points in the same direction as another. A measure of [[similarity]] in vectorspace. 

**geometric**
Magnitudes of vectors, scaled by angle between them.
If 0, vectors are orthogonal
If positive, vectors converge
If negative, vectors are pointing in the opposite direction

**signal processing**
Sum of elements in one vector, weighted by elements of another vector.

**statistics**
covariance or similarity between two vectors
