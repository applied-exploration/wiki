A hash function is any deterministic [[Function]] that can be used to [[Map]] data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values. 

This can be any non-injective function (so has no [[Inverse function]]), that would map input elements to non-unique [[solution]]s, creating [[Overlap]]s in the codomain.


**Small change in input -> small change in output**
Local [[Decomposition]] may be possible with locality sensitive hashing

**Small change in input -> big change in output**
Cryptography Global [[Inverse function]][[Decomposition]] is hard/impossible
