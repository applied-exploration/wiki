The tradeoff between [[computing]] everything vs [[Memorizing]] everything.

**Lossy**
Approxiamate storage where the invariant is generally the human perceptual system.

Can be thought off as [[Dimensionality reduction]] where the variations lost are not meaningful to humans.

**Lossless**

Represents data by extracting invariants (common elements). aka [[Pattern matching]]
