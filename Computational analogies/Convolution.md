A technique for determining the most important portions of a signal.
Used in machine learning for [[Feature learning]]

A frequency filter.

A special case of a reduce function.

Measures [[correlation]] between two functions. (A function and a reversed function to be precise)

Weighted "average" with defined weights.
Depending on the weights (also called kernel) it can have different effects. Eg.: 
[1, 2, 1] = blur = averaging
[-1, 5, -1] = sharpen = amplifying
[-2, 0, 2] = right sobel = derivative (measuring it's rate of change in a given direction)

The effect of convolution is to smear the signal in time according to the recipe provided by the response function

**[[Dot product]]**
compmute the dot product between two vectors, then shift one in time and compute the dot again, and so on...
