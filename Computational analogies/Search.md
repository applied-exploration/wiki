Search is a way to find an element in a collection or a solution to a problem.
There's no search without an underlying data structure that provides the structure of the search (1D - list, nD - graphs).

Search generally needs information (heuristic) directing the search. 
A direction can be given as a herustic to the search algorithm, that implies an [[order]]ing between the elements of search. A sort of [[similarity]] along a given [[direction]].

Search is generally related to [[Optimization]].

**Along one dimension:**
One exception is linear search, where you evaluate all the possibilities. But as soon as you sorted your data you can use binary search to [[speed up]] the search by doing less.

**Along multiple dimensions:**
2D Heuristic: Euclidian distance.
