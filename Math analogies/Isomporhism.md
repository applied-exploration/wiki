Equivalence?

A morphism _f_: _X_ → _Y_ is called an isomorphism if there exists a morphism _g_: _Y_ → _X_ such that _f_ ∘ _g_ = id_Y_ and _g_ ∘ _f_ = id_X_. If a morphism has both left-inverse and right-inverse, then the two inverses are equal, so _f_ is an isomorphism, and _g_ is called simply the **inverse** of _f_. Inverse morphisms, if they exist, are unique.
In set theory, morphisms are functions in linear algebra, linear transformations in group theor, group homomorphisms in topology, continuous functions, and so on.
