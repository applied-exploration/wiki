An inverse of a [[Function]] is a another function that maps it's outputs to it's inputs. 

Undoes the effect of a function.

Complicating is that this mapping sometimes would not yield unique solutions, when the original function is not [[bijective]] (one-to-one). In this case you can use partial inverses that restrict the domain of the function. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function#Inverses_and_derivatives
