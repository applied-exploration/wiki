An example of [[unsupervised learning]]
Autoencoders are forced to reconstruct the input approximately, preserving only the most relevant aspects of the data in the copy.

[[generative model]]: Autoencoders are generative models, they can randomly generate new data similar to the training input data.
[[Hash functions]]: Search can become more efficient in certain kinds of low dimensional spaces, such as the latent space of an autoencoder.
