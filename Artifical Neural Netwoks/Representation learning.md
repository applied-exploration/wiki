The performance simple machine learning algorithms depends heavily on the representation of the data they are given. operations such as searching a collection of data can proceed exponentially faster if the collection is structured and indexed intelligently. People can easily perform arithmetic on Arabic numerals but ﬁnd arithmetic on Roman numerals much more time consuming. For many tasks, however, it is diﬃcult to know what features should be extracted.
**One solution to this problem is to use machine learning to discover not only the mapping from representation to output but also the representation itself.**

"A major source of diﬃculty in many real-world artiﬁcial intelligence applications
is that many of the [[factors of variation]] inﬂuence every single piece of data we are
able to observe. The individual pixels in an image of a red car might be very close
to black at night. The shape of the car’s silhouette depends on the viewing angle.
Most applications require us to [[disentangle]] the factors of variation and discard the
ones that we do not care about... 
Deep learning solves this central problem in representation learning by introducing representations that are expressed in terms of other, simpler representations."
